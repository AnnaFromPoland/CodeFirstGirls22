# Mobile Development: Week 3 Homework

Week 3 Homework required us to work with git hub and submit our sandbox (a scratch book / exercise book kind of an app where we tested the things we were learning) so that we'd practice git commands, frequent and clear commits (according to the "atomic commits" read we were given), but we had to upload it as a separate repository - see [my sandbox here](https://github.com/AnnaFromPoland/sandbox).
